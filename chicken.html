        <h2>Misty Mountains</h2>
        <p>
            Far over the Misty Mountains cold <br>
            To dungeons deep and caverns old <br>
            We must await, ere break of day, <br>
            To find our long forgotten gold. <br>
            <br>
            The pines were roaring on the height, <br>
            The winds were moaning in the night. <br>
            The fire was red, it flaming spread; <br>
            The trees like torches blazed with light. <br>
            <br>
            The wind was on the withered heath, <br>
            But in the forest stirred no leaf: <br>
            There shadows lay be night or day, <br>
            And dark things silent crept beneath. <br>
            <br>
            The wind went on from West to East; <br>
            All movement in the forest ceased, <br>
            But shrill and harsh across the marsh <br>
            Its whistling voices were released. <br>
            <br>
            Farewell we call to hearth and hall! <br>
            Though wind may blow and rain may fall, <br>
            We must await ere break of day <br>
            Far over wood and mountain tall. <br>
            <br>
        </p>

            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">junglefowl</a> originally from
            Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a
            cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually
            immature female is called a pullet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
            Asia,<sup>[5]</sup> but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from
            the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
            Greece by the 5th century BC.<sup>[6]</sup> Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC,
            with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia,
            according to the annals of Thutmose III.<sup>[7][8][9]</sup>
